## Purpose
The purpose of the ITT DIMR (Invitation To Tender Digital Minimum Requirements) is to manage expectations of the Trust's digital requirements down the supply chain. DIMR enables the Trust to identify, against the procurement in question, what requirements need to be inserted into an ITT and will need to be considered during assurance activities, contract negotiations, signature and implementation.

## Scope
DIMR applies to every contract for works, goods or services supplied to Dorset HealthCare that will result in the provision, use or letting of an IT system by Trust staff

## Usage
* The DIMR menu shall be used by the Trust to identify and apply relevant requirements to the procurements of IT systems
* It is therefore not intended that the full DIMR menu be applied to procurements, it is produced here for interest and the awareness of suppliers.
* Where a DIMR menu is produced, it shall be issued as part of the invitation to tender (ITT)
* The solution provider shall evaluate the solution or service against each requirement identified by the Trust. In the case of differences between the issued DIMR menu and the requirements of the solution or service the solution provider shall give a clear explanation of the reason for these differences as part of the tender.
* Requirement levels (MUST, MAY, SHOULD etc.) are defined by Internet Engineering Taskforce RFC 2119: [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
